{{< anchor "Design_Challenges" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Design Challenges
------------------------------------------------------------------

To select their class projects, students review and vote their interest among a set of Design Challenges. These are short project proposals compiled by D-Lab staff, based on criteria including community partner interest, past D-Lab activity, and overall value.

Voting happens with the Project Selection Form, which also helps the instructors create teams with an appropriate mix of skills, backgrounds and interests.

*   Project Selection Form ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mitec_720js10_proj_select))

The following table lists the six design challenges selected by the Spring 2010 class to become class projects, followed by brief summaries of the other candidates not selected by the class.

{{< anchor "Design_Packet" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Design Packet
----------------------------------------------------------

The Design Packet describes the sequence of process steps and milestones to be followed by the design teams. The earlier steps serve as homework assignments, leading into a final phase of prototype fabrication, testing, and evaluation.
