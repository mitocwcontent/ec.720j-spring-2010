This page presents additional resources on the D-Lab design process.

Design Process
--------------

Creative Capacity Building Design Notebook ([PDF - 2.9MB]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mitec_720js10_ccbdesign))  
This document is used in D-Lab's Creative Capacity Building (CCB) workshops in communities around the world to help trained facilitators guide people through the creative design process. As workshop participants have diverse backgrounds, the resource is richly illustrated and uses examples that may be more relevant in rural communities. The CCB notebook is analogous to the D-Lab: Design class notebook in some ways, and people who are less familiar with the design cycle that we use may find this to be a useful additional resource.

Design Mentoring
----------------

A group of design mentors works with the student teams during the semester, primarily to provide feedback during in-class design reviews, as well as assist with outside meetings and conversations.
